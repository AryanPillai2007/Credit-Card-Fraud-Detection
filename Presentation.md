# Presentation of Findings

## Overview

I had the opportunity to present the findings of my **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project at the **North Texas ISSA (Information Systems Security Association)**. The presentation focused on the methodology, key insights, and results obtained from analyzing and modeling the credit card fraud dataset.

Here is a link to a PDF of my presentation. Thanks you!

## Presentation Highlights

- **Introduction to the Problem**: Discussed the challenges of detecting fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.
- **Data Exploration**: Explained the class imbalance and the distribution of transaction amounts and times.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Highlighted the importance of scaling and outlier removal for improving model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Shared the results of various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, and Decision Tree.
- **Key Findings**: Emphasized the effectiveness of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier in detecting fraud with high precision and recall.
